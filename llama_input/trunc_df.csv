Essay1: Official statistics are those produced by either the state, or by one of its agencies. There has been a huge increase in the number of official statistics since the Central Statistics Office was set up in 1941, and now large quantities of statistics are produced on a variety of different topics, for example income, housing and population. Although they are widely used there are many limitations of the use official statistics in sociology. In this essay I plan to talk about how the internal, or posivitist schools view statistics, looking at how they are critical of the reliability and validity of official statistics, and also how they feel that the processes involved in producing the statistics limit their uses. I will also explore the uses that statistics do have in sociology, and come to a conclusion on whether they should be use or not. The internal school of thought emphasises the need for reliability and validity in order to produce realistic statistics, however there are many problems with official statistics in this aspect, and as Hindess points out ""
Essay2: Since the fourteenth century the practice of medicine has become a profession, and more importantly, a male-dominated profession. Previously medicine was seen as a female duty, however all areas of medicine have been professionalized over the centuries, and slowly become male-dominated, even the practice of obstetrics, which until the twentieth century, was still viewed as a female responsibility. This rise of medicine has had many implications for women; in this essay I will discuss them. The most important, both in terms of gender and class, was the exclusion of women from what had previously been a female occupation, and their confinement into inferior areas of medicine. However I will also examine the effects the rise of the profession of medicine had on women in relation to how women were viewed from the nineteenth century onward, and also the practical impacts that it had upon women receiving treatment, especially in the case of childbirth. In terms of class I will look at how working-class women received different treatments, as

Essay2: Racism is still a problem within our society today, and many ethnic minorities face inequalities in many areas, including education, housing, and employment. Ethnic minorities are concentrated into certain areas of the job market, such as manufacture and communication (Brown, 1992), are most likely to be the victims of assault (Abercrombie et al, 1994), and recent surveys have shown that racist ideas still exist in society. This can be seen in a survey, carried out in 1993, that asked a white sample whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement: 'Immigration has enriched the quality of life in Britain' and nearly half of the sample disagreed (Abercrombie et al, 1994, p255).

Essay2: Much more reproductive choice is now available to women, with the ability to chose whether or not to have children, when to have them and in what context, now a reproductive right given to women. This, combined with shifting social and economic opportunities for women, has lead to an increase in the number of childless women, with, in 1991, twice as many saying that they expected to remain childless as in 1986 (Gillespie, 2001).

Essay1: Victorian notions of women's madness were largely influenced by the Victorian Domestic Ideology; paramount during the nineteenth century in defining gender roles, responsibilities and acceptable behaviour. This primarily concerned the middle classes, establishing ideals of womanhood and femininity that were arguably damaging both to those directly targeted as well as other groups within Victorian society striving to emulate the middle class depiction of morality, sobriety and modesty. At the same time, the notion of madness as a disease was becoming increasingly apparent within Victorian society, further highlighting gender and class divisions through varying perceptions of madness and its origins. Whilst there were significant implications in terms of gender, this essay will mainly deal with the effects of social class on women's experience of madness in Victorian England. Firstly, it is important to understand that madness, in all its various forms, was seen as a female illness. Femininity became inextricably linked with hysteria, along with neurasthen
Essay2: The development of feminist thought and action in Japan is distinct from that of its emergence in the West, more specifically within the United States and Britain. Though influenced by Western politics, the development of feminism in Japan was also initiated by numerous other social and political factors that affected the political climate at that specific time and place. Adherence to Confucian ideologies severely restricted women within Japanese society, as well as subordinating the working classes and those not owning property. A growing political awareness and imperialist competition later led to the struggle for social reform, of which women were arguably at the forefront. This essay will deal with such social and political factors as these to account for the development of feminism in Japan. The subordinate position of women within Japanese society came to be highlighted at the end of the nineteenth century, whereas previously notions of the 'natural inferiority of women'1 had been largely unchallenged. This had implications for the rights of women concerning property, marriage and divorce, amongst

Essay1: On Friday afternoon, the 26 th of November, I conducted my ethnographic observation in an urban setting in the centre of Leamington. My first intention was to observe activity and interaction in a second hand book shop, paying special attention to variables such as gender and age, and their potential relation to areas of interest. This, as we will see, proved to be difficult. Also, I intended to record noteworthy or unusual behaviour that might be caused by social circumstances particular to the shop. Around 1.45 pm I entered the shop, and at that moment there were about three customers around, apart from the two shopkeepers. The shop, called Portland Books has an authentic and old-fashioned atmosphere, with its wooden floor, narrow space and antique, hardback books on old wooden shelves. Besides old and new books, the shop also sells postcards and old placard photos. The counter is situated downstairs, in the middle of the shop. A small staircase leads

Essay2: Rousseau has always been typified as an intellectual outsider; it was, however, only in the twentieth century that his socio-political theory came to be seen as a threat to the individual's liberty. Emphasis thereby is often laid on his concept of a 'general will', through which personal liberty is handed over to the collective. 'The citizens having but one interest', Rousseau argues, 'the people [have] but a single will'. And although Rousseau favours the ballot vote, he argues for the infallibility of its ruling: 'when the opinion contrary to my own prevails, it proves nothing more than that I made a mistake, and that what I took to be the general will was not'.

Essay2: At the eve of the Versailles conference, promoters of the Polish cause immediately realised the international precariousness of their aims to forge the rebirth of an independent Polish state.

Essay2: Rousseau has always been typified as an intellectual outsider; it was, however, only in the twentieth century that his socio-political theory came to be seen as a threat to the individual's liberty. Emphasis thereby is often laid on his concept of a 'general will', through which personal liberty is handed over to the collective. 'The citizens having but one interest', Rousseau argues, 'the people [have] but a single will'. And although Rousseau favours the ballot vote, he argues for the infallibility of its ruling: 'when the opinion contrary to my own prevails, it proves nothing more than that I made a mistake, and that what I took to be the general will was not'. From the point of view of Rousseau, most importantly protection should be rendered against the emergence of a minority rule, or 'particular will', rather than against the state, which, after all, represents the sovereignty of

Essay2: The writing of Simmel on the discipline of sociology is characterised by a desire to reduce the study of society to its essence. Instead of viewing society as Durkheim did, that is, as a generic force working externally of the individual and reifying itself through organisational structures and artefacts, Simmel was rather concerned with giving a 'serious [...]analysis of the social bond' (Nisbit 1959: 479), which can be described as the reciprocally working relation between two or more social actors. He denounced the view that a society ""as such"" could exist outside individuals (Simmel 1971a: 27), preferring to build a sociological system from the individual's standpoint. In the first place, Simmel represented social interaction as the dynamic attempt to reconcile the opposite drives within each human being - 'for example, the individual and the group, the need for conformity and for individuation

Essay2: In negotiating the post-war political landscape of Eastern Europe, the western powers revealed an ambiguous attitude. Although historians still disagree on whether diplomatic misunderstandings between the allies of the east and west eventually caused the emergence of a cold war, or whether a gradual loss of influence in Eastern European countries was the reason for its outbreak, the half-hearted commitment to their self-proclaimed defense of liberal democratic principles such as democracy and regional stability prompted disillusioned contemporaries to see the allied settlement of Eastern Europe as again one of unprincipled compromise and appeasement.

Essay2: AbstractIn this dissertation it is argued that the development of critical realism by Roy Bhaskar is a positive development for sociology. By successfully critiquing empiricism Bhaskar has developed an approach that can be used to highlight the deficiencies that have been associated with the traditional ontologies available in sociology. It will be shown that Margaret Archer effectively launched an immanent critique of the said sociological ontologies by using the realist ontology. It is also argued that she has constructed a worthwhile methodological complement to the realist ontology. The dissertation then attempts to prove these claims through a discussion of three of the most famous expositions of the concept of power. However, it is through these discussions that it is revealed that sociology will not have to sacrifice its critical character by adopting the realist ontology in toto. This is because there will inevitably be disagreement over the 'essentially contested' nature of our familiar concepts. In conclusion, the view will be advanced that

Essay1: For too long the history of the Cold War has been written from a 'top-down' perspective examining elites and decision-makers. Whilst political scientists have become mired in using rational International Relations models, historians have rarely cast their net beyond realpolitik, frequently falling foul of detailed narrative around contingencies which often never occurred. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the 30-year rule for many documents in the West, which both led to a spate of archival-based sources available to historians, cemented this diplomatic and empirical approach. Moreover, archival work alone is a dangerous place from which to survey the Cold War, since both sides of the Iron Curtain employed 'newspeak' rather than rational discourse, even behind closed doors. In short, this 'New Cold War history' can become overly narrative driven and blind to broader analysis. However, as a result of the growing interest in cultural history following the 19

Essay1: SummaryThe aim of this experiment was to carry out an enzyme assay to study the effects of pH, temperature and product inhibition on an enzyme and calculate the Michaelis constant and order or reaction. This was carried out by assaying alkaline phosphotase under different conditions measuring the extent of reaction with a spectrophotometer. It was discovered that the optimum pH was 9.5 whilst the optimum temperature is 42 oC and activity decreases either side of these optimums due to disruption at the active site or denaturing of the enzyme. Phosphate was found to carry out product inhibition and the reaction was determined as first order. The Michaelis constant was calculated to be 0.0871. IntroductionEnzymes are biological catalysts (they accelerate the rate of a reaction without themselves undergoing any net change) and catalyse most of the chemical reactions taking place in the cell. They carry out this catalysis by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower energy transition
Essay2: SummaryThe experiment aimed to investigate conjugation and recombination in Esherichia coli and determine the chromosomal order of a number of genes for amino acid synthesis and sugar metabolism. This was carried out by mixing donor and recipient strains and at certain time intervals interrupting the mating and plating on selective media. Qualitative assessment of the plates was then used to map the gene order. The chromosomal gene order was found to be thr, arg and xyl, ilv, leu, pro, his (see discussion for explanation of gene names). IntroductionBacterial DNA can be exchanged between different strains allowing new allele combinations to be produced. This means that a 'wild type' gene can be passed to a strain with a mutation in this gene and through recombination the gene activity can be restored. The most common mechanisms of genetic exchange are transformation, transduction and conjugation. In each case genetic material is transferred from the donor strain to the recipient strain and this is assessed

Essay1: IntroductionThe diagram below shows the generalised amino acid: It can be seen that apart from having an amino group (A terminus) and a carboxyl group (C terminus) the amino acid also has an 'R' group. It is this 'R' group which determines each amino acid and gives it specific characteristics such as charge. A term used to describe an amino acid with respect to it's charge is 'isoelectric point'. This is the pH at which the overall charge on the amino acid is neutral. As amino acids are the subunits of proteins, it is the charge of an amino acid which can determine the three dimensional structure of proteins by influencing the bonding which occurs. If adjacent amino acids are oppositely charged due to the differing properties of their 'R' groups, then electrostatic forces will occur and part of the three dimensional structure of the protein will be formed. The differing charges of amino acids can also be used to identify amino acids in a protein

Essay2: Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis by floral dip, and selection of transformantsIntroductionTransformation as a process of genetic exchange is widely used for producing transgenetic plants. Like many bacteria Agrobacterium possess DNA in the form of a plasmid in addition to its main genome. Under normal circumstances this plasmid contains the vir genes which causes part of the plasmid to self-replicate and insert itself into the genome of the plant host cells. This then alters hormone production and causes the development of galls or tumours in the plants. The bacterial T-DNA i.e. the portion of the plasmid that becomes integrated in the plant genome can be modified such that its incorporation does not cause tumour formation, but instead confers foreign genes (such as those for antibiotic resistance) upon the plants phenotype.

Essay2: AbstractThis essay investigates the different types of stem cells, their origins and properties and why these characteristics have generated so much hope that stem cells can offer solutions to numerous different diseases and medical conditions. IntroductionStem cells are a unique population of cells found in both adult and foetal tissues which have the ability to renew themselves, to remain undifferentiated and to respond to specific signals and conditions, triggering differentiation. Within adult tissues (such as bone marrow, the brain and muscle), stem cells act to replace cells lost naturally, by disease or through injury. As such, adult stem cells are multipotent and can renew their own population and differentiate to yield the specific cells of their originating tissue. An example of this is shown in Figure 1 where haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) found in the bone marrow may divide symmetrically to regenerate their own population, or asymmetrically forming a further HSC and a daughter cell, the latter of

Essay1: As an introduction to the essay question posed a very brief and simplified summary of Habermas's main ideas and theories seems appropriate. Habermas argued that from the late nineteenth century science, technology and industry became interdependent forming a new kind of capitalism. Habermas viewed this interdependence as meaning capitalist growth had no limits because science and technology were the new leading productive forces. This new form of capitalism used a different kind of production and allowed the '...biblical curse of necessary labour,' to be broken 'technologically'. (Habermas, 1970; 53). Originally capitalism had legitimated itself through economic notions of just exchange in the market, however due to the changes within capitalism, the exchange process itself now operated under political control. This new capitalism also required direct legitimation, this time using culture. Habermas argued that this led to a 'depoliticisation' of society, which was legitimated 'by having technology and science also

Essay2: The most extensive population study of the early modern period was carried out by E.A. Wrigley and R.S. Schofield, The Population History of England, 1541 - 1871: A Reconstruction, which set out calculated estimates of population trends for this period. They used the method of back-projection to estimate the population levels of the country between 1541 (the beginning of the first decade after the introduction of parish registers) and 1871 (the date of the second reliable census). This project was an immense undertaking which used four hundred and four surviving parish registers which recorded baptism, marriage and burial, to estimate demographic trends at five year intervals between these two dates.

Essay1: The most extensive population study of the early modern period was carried out by E.A. Wrigley and R.S. Schofield, The Population History of England, 1541 - 1871: A Reconstruction, which set out calculated estimates of population trends for this period. They used the method of back-projection to estimate the population levels of the country between 1541 (the beginning of the first decade after the introduction of parish registers) and 1871 (the date of the second reliable census). This project was an immense undertaking which used four hundred and four surviving parish registers which recorded baptism, marriage and burial, to estimate demographic trends at five year intervals between these two dates.

Essay2: By 1930 Stalin had not only managed to gain extensive personal control and eliminated all his opponents but had also managed to consolidate this power. Accountable to very few Stalin was free to pursue any policy largely unchecked. He had support from the party rank and file as well as from the central committee and the Politburo. How Stalin, the least obvious of Lenin's potential successors, came to be in this position is a much contested issue. With his death Lenin left a vacuum within the party leadership creating economic, social and political uncertainty. This in turn led to a left / right divide within the Politburo over the next steps the Bolsheviks should take, with Trotsky on the left arguing for rapid industrialisation. Stalin maintained a generally moderate position before siding with Kamenev and Zinoviev forming a powerful triumvate against the man they saw as their biggest rival. After Trotsky's eventual exp

Essay2: To answer a question on Russia, I think it is first necessary to give some general details about this extraordinary and difficult to classify country. Russia stands eight thousand miles long, for much of the year it is landlocked, surrounded by foreign powers with whom it shares seas and rivers with. Russia has specific producer regions upon which some areas are dependent; Russia's variable climate makes growing hard in many areas. Russia's population in 1905 was very large and very mixed, only about fifty percent of this population was infact Russian. Nationalities including Ukrainians, Polish and Armenians made this a multi-cultural, multi-religious country which was very hard to generalise about demographically. In terms of classes, Russia had some more traditional groups such as peasants, landowners, autocracy and merchants.

Essay1: Dividing development into distinct stages has occurred in many areas of psychology, but most frequently in cognitive development of children and adolescents. There has always been disagreement as to whether development should be categorised in stages or whether it is a constantly moving process which never stops. Flavell (1977) suggested that stages in development must show distinct, qualitative changes rather than differences in quantitative ability. He also noted that transition between stages must incur several simultaneous changes in many areas of cognition, and that these transitions should be rapid rather than gradual. Some psychologists have tried to suggest that development is an accumulation of small qualitative changes over time, causing smooth, continuous improvement, called linear dynamics, (Harris & Butterworth, 2002), however most parents and teachers will agree that children's development does feature many sudden periods of growth. There have been a number of stage models of cognitive development in recent psychology, which tend to agree on many points, such as the number of
Essay2: IntroductionResearchers have argued that road crossing skills in children depend on attentional skills and ability to concentrate on a task during a distracting event. Dunbar, Lewis and Hill (2001) found that children showing greater attention switching skills were more aware of traffic when observed crossing roads and that maintaining attention throughout distractions might indicate a greater likelihood of crossing roads in a safe manner. Previous studies had used attention switching tasks such as reporting letters and numbers heard in either of two auditory streams, i.e. attending to the left or right ear (Pearson & Lane, 1991), to assess differences in time taken to move attention between the streams. It was found that younger children took longer and showed higher error rates when switching attention than older children, suggesting that attention skills improve with age. This study aims to test the idea that attentional skills improve with age, using the test of everyday attention for children, whereby children must inhibit their natural responses while a distracting event occurs.

Essay2: Qualitative research is theoretically research that leads to dichotomous results, i.e. data values of zero or one; however in psychology qualitative findings are usually those not arrived at by statistical methods, (Grohol, 2005). Methods are usually naturalistic and involve observing behaviour without manipulating variables. Qualitative methods are often thus considered less scientific than quantitative methods, yet they play a vital role in understanding behaviour in its natural environment and are frequently used to develop hypotheses and theories, giving exploratory analysis which can aid quantitative experimental design. Due to the inductive nature of qualitative research, however, it can only be a useful medium when explored in sufficient detail; therefore validity and reliability are critical to its utility. Since qualitative research differs so greatly from quantitative study, researchers have developed non-quantitative criteria for assessing reliability and validity. For instance, Guba and Lincoln, (1994), proposed four criteria for judging the soundness of qualitative research, e.g

Annihilations have occurred in many countries throughout the century including Turkey, Rwanda, China, Bosnia and Cambodia, and whilst there are significant differences between each one- such as method of slaughter, death toll and time span of persecution- there are some factors common to them all. In fact, the Holocaust was not even the first great massacre of the twentieth century as the Armenian genocide occurred during the First World War, and Melson argues that it is 'a more accurate archetype than is the Holocaust for current mass murder in the postcolonial third world and in the contemporary post-communist world'.

Essay2: As Alfred Crosby notes 'it is impossible to doubt that the transfer of Old World foods and livestock to the Americas had an immense impact on the Indian'.

However, the speed and success of such reception varies among the different foodstuffs that colonisers attempted to introduce; whilst meat and vegetables complemented the indigenous diet, attempts to present wheat as a superior staple to maize were far less successful. Many of the products cultivated in the Americas were primarily for the consumption of colonial settlers, or indeed exportation back to Europe, and therefore although there was some acceptance of Old World products into Indian diets, on the whole it was not until the eighteenth century onwards that a genuine fusion of cuisines began to take place.

Essay2: London was growing rapidly during the Tudor and Stuart period. As the population of the country as a whole doubled, the population of London quadrupled. In 1500 the population was just 50,000, but this had risen to 490,000 by 1700. There was a low fertility rate as only a small proportion of people were married and the poor living conditions in the capital resulted in a high mortality rate; yet the population continued to rise. The explanation for this comes from the high level of migration into the city. In order to counter the effects of low fertility and high mortality rates on the population, London needed around 7,000 migrants entering the city every year to grow at the rate it did.

The Italian Renaissance is generally associated with the fifteenth century. This period, however, can be stretched in either direction. For example, the term ""Renaissance"" has been used to describe some thirteenth-century artists, and the great artists of the Renaissance were active until the end of the sixteenth century. The rebirth of the visual arts was one aspect of the Renaissance but the development of humanism and the classical studies of the universities were as important. There were also advancements in music, literature, science and government practices during this period. How far Florence was responsible for these developments can be debated. Robert Black asserts that 'the elitism of Florentine society and the monopoly which the Florentine patriciate had over classical culture made Florence the first and greatest capital of the

Essay1: Qualitative research is associated with meanings and interpretation. It is not reliant upon numerical data as quantitative research is and focuses more upon the context in which behaviour is recorded. The reliability and validity of qualitative research has often been questioned as the analysis of its findings are often open to interpretation (Burman, 1994). Because of this it has previously been claimed that the method is not reliable or valid, although these two terms have always been defined in terms of quantitative research. It is possible that qualitative research is at least as reliable and valid as quantitative research when the definition of what is ""reliable"" and what is ""valid"" is altered to reflect the specialist nature of the qualitative method (Merrick, 1993). In quantitative terms reliability is defined as being the extent to which a particular study could be replicated and the same results achieved (Colman, 2001). Validity can be defined as the extent to which a test measures that which it claims to
Essay2: AbstractThis study investigated whether first year university females had significantly more disordered eating than a control group of non-university females. It was hypothesised that low self esteem as a result of leaving home for the first time, and having to integrate a new peer group would be the cause of this. Questionnaires were used to measure participants eating behaviour, body shape satisfaction and self esteem. Attitudes towards the new peer group were measured using specific questions on the self esteem questionnaire. It was found that the first year students did have significantly more disordered eating than the control group, although having low self esteem and integrating a new peer group were not significant causes of this. It may be that low self esteem and having to integrate a new peer group play a part in increasing eating deviancy in first year students, although these may not have been shown to be significant because they combine with other factors associated with university life such as stress and depression. It was clearly found, however, that first year females

Essay2: Popularity is an extremely difficult concept to measure as popularity is variable across cultures and ages. Characteristics defining a child as popular at the age of 8 may not be the same characteristics which define a child as popular at 14. Another problem arises distinguishing friendship from popularity. A child may be perceived as unpopular but still have a few close friends, and it is important to consider this when looking at psychological development because popularity is multi-faceted as opposed to one dimensional. It has been shown that unpopular children are more likely to have psychological difficulties such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and criminal behaviour (Kupersmidt, Coie and Dodge, 1990). Because of this, an important issue when looking at the effect of popularity on psychological development is cause and effect. This issue is covered extensively in the essay as it is valuable, yet difficult, to try and determine whether being unpopular causes problems with psychological development, or whether underlying psychological

Essay2: Human colour vision can most often be described as trichromatic. Having trichromatic colour vision entails having three types of wavelength specific cones in the retina, each of which are maximally responsive to short, medium or long wavelengths of light in the colour spectrum. Short, medium and long wavelength cones maximally respond to blue, green and red light respectively (Goldstein, 2002). Trichromacy is not a uniform feature of human physiology however. Because colour vision is inherited genetically, with medium and long wavelength specific genes being located on the x chromosome, mutations can occur. These mutations can cause a type of colour blindness called anomalous trichromacy, in which the red photopsin becomes slightly shifted (Sanocki, Shevell, Winderickx, 1993).

Essay1: It has long been recognised that emotions exert powerful effects on memory, and that what we feel can strongly influence what we remember. The types of effects that emotion can have on memory differ markedly, depending on the precise conditions of encoding and retrieval (Eich, Kihlstrom, Bower, Forgas & Miedenthal, 2000). Differences in emphasis during encoding, for example, can have a profound effect on how, or indeed whether, information is remembered later (Gleitman, 1999) and similarly, the emotional state of a person at the time of retrieval may influence what they remember. Two central questions have arisen out of the study of the impact of emotion on memory; firstly, whether emotion increases or decreases the strength of memory for an event, and secondly, whether special mechanisms are required to account for the effects of emotion on memory (Eich et al, 2000).

Essay2: The term 'meme' was first introduced by Richard Dawkins in 1976. Dawkins popularised the influential view that evolution is best understood in terms of competition between genes (Blackmore, 1999), and in his conception of memes he takes this one step further, drawing on the analogy between genetic and cultural evolution to claim that culture can be split into units called memes; ideas, habits, skills, stories or any kind of behaviour or information that is copied from person to person by imitation (Dawkins, 1976). Memes are the replicators of the cultural world; the smallest elements of culture or complex ideas that replicate themselves with reliability and fecundity (Dennett, 1993). Like genes, memes are selfish. They pursue their own interests and are concerned only with their survival and replication. Since each mind has a limited capacity for memes, there is considerable competition among memes for entry

Essay2: High levels of avoidance coping have consistently been found to be predictive of problem drinking, which is highest among young adults. Students in particular have greatly elevated levels of drinking in comparison to the general population. One hundred undergraduates were asked about the way they cope with a high academic workload. Alcohol consumption was found to correlate positively with avoidance coping and negatively with seeking social support. Thus students who attempt to disengage and forget about their problems, and those who do not like to seek help or confide in others, are typically those with higher levels of alcohol consumption. Further research could investigate whether high levels of alcohol consumption avoidance coping significantly impact academic achievement. IntroductionWhen confronted by a stressful situation, an individual may react in any one of a variety of ways, ranging from attempting to actively address the problem and tackle it 'head-on', to merely forgetting about it and hoping it will disappear.

Their work rages with controversy as with their theories that still spark incessant debates. Both are eminent psychologist that studied aspects of human behaviour concerned with obedience to an authoritative figure. Both psychologists studied this phenomenon differently using different methods. Zimbardo created a make-shift prison and Milgram created an electric shock experiment, to ultimately deduce the same conclusion. The conceptual reason behind Zimbardo's experiment was to test the power of social situations over individuals. The focus was on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity, and situational validation of ordinarily ego-alien behaviors and behavioral styles. Zimbardo explored the theory of deindividuation and its influence on obedience. The psychological state of deindividuation is aroused when individuals become part of a crowd or large group. This state is characterized by diminished self-awareness
Essay2: What is a psychological disorder? A psychological disorder can be defined as a dysfunction within an individual that is associated with distress or impairment in functioning and a response that is not typical. The behaviourist approach in psychology understands human behaviour as a consequence of conditioning. This approach claims that all human behaviour is shaped by reinforcement from the environment and the consequences of actions. Humans become conditioned to respond to our environment as a result of leaning by association or operant. Learning by association or classical conditioning is attributed to Ivan Pavlov and his theory of classical conditioning, while operant conditioning, or learning by way of reward and unpleasant consequence, is credited to BF Skinner. Operant conditioning states that all behaviour is a result of learning, of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment. (Skinner, B. F., 1974) Perhaps a person has been rewarded for doing exhibiting certain behaviour in the past and these acts as positive reinforcement and helps sustain the behaviour. Similarly, a person

Executive SummaryThe report consisted of the design and analysis of a commercial meat slicer, which connected between an AC motor with speed of 1800rpm and a grinder with an output speed of ~90rpm. A variety of calculations would be performed for different major components. Computer program would also be used in order to compare the results from computer modeling to manual calculations. A computer aid design drawing would be conducted and presented near the final stage and an appropriate size of gearbox housing would be designed. After the analysis the optimal gearbox should have a double reduction system with gear ratios of 4.472. Optimal gears would have a size of 36mm and 161mm gear diameters with 27mm thickness and the optimal shafts would have a diameter of 12mm and 25mm with a length of 100mm.

Essay2: Traditional accounts on the causes of the Reformation necessarily included castigation of clerical abuses, such as concubinage, pluralism and absenteeism; the ignorance and poor training of priests and monks; and perhaps even the supposed failure of papal leadership as manifestations of the decay and decline of the Church on the eve of the Reformation. This view, and the more recent revisionist view of the topic in question has informed the main body of debate in scholarly circles, but before embarking on the essay, there are a few points that deserve attention. Firstly, the question suggests that what was 'wrong' with the Church could have led, in some sort of linear equation, to the birth of the Reformation. Following in the footsteps of Peter Marshall, ""the intention is not to sift the evidence for signs of impending Reformation"", and teleological history should be avoided due to the inaccurate interpretations and conclusions which may emerge from that approach.

Essay2: It was in the historical context of the religious and political upheaval of the 1640s, and the subsequent breakdown of censorship (which made fertile ground for the ferment of radical ideas), that Winstanley first made his appearance as a pamphleteer. Considering that Winstanley was only prominent as a writer between 1648-1652, and thereafter faded into oblivion, there seems to be a disproportionate amount of literature written about him, with little consensus over how we should understand such a complex figure. The most prominent debate revolves around Winstanley's evolution as a thinker- while most agree that he started off as a religious thinker, few concur on his predilections (secular or religious or both) in the Law of Freedom in a Platform (1652).

Essay1: A disease slowly destroys your oligodendroglia cellsOligodendroglia cells are held in the sheath of Schwann, which covers myelin and provides insulation to the neurons in the central nervous system. The axon of each neuron is protected by a myelin sheath, this ensures the transmission of signals and allows nerve impulses to be propagated to the next neuron. This mylelination has a strong impact on behaviours as it profoundly increases the velocity of nerve impulses and thereby affects the temporal order of events in the nervous system (Biological Psychology, 2002, p. 69). Normal transmissions are so fast and automatic that it is hard to accept a delay between a thought and a muscle contraction. The speed of nerve conduction due to the presence of the oligodendroglia cells is up to approximately 260 miles per hour (Psychology 5 th ed
Essay2: The authoritarian personality is a personality type that predisposes a person to obey unquestionably. People with this personality type are said to be prejudice against minority groups and believe strongly in obeying authority. They also have a general belief in the importance of power and dominance, and the insignificance of those below them. This is because they feel weak and therefore feel they need to be part of a powerful group and have a powerful leader. The authoritarian personality has shown a trend in personality patterns formed in childhood. Research has found that those who score highly on authoritarianism tend to describe their childhood as being dominated by stern harsh fathers who insisted on absolute obedience. This theory is predominately a psychodynamic one as it is based on the idea of 'reaction formation', as a forbidden impulse is re-channelled into a safer course.
