381532,"Manufacturing strategy formulation2.1Manufacturing strategy academic definition and framework(Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984) gave a clear definition for manufacturing strategy: The primary function of a manufacturing strategy is to guide the business in putting together the set of manufacturing capabilities that will enable it to pursue its chosen competitive strategy over the long term. In other words, manufacturing strategy can give a company a competitive advantage. During the past years, manufacturing strategy's role has changed absolutely. The cooperation strategy was focus on marketing and finance as competitive advantage and manufacturing was a tool to implement it before 1980s. Then, manufacturing was gradually considered as a part of cooperation strategy and can provide competitive advantage for companies. (Terry, 2000) explained more about its two important roles as part of the strategic strengths of a company. The first is to provide outstanding manufacturing process with unique technology and operations which is hard to be replicated by competitors. It can be an advantage in marketplace. The other one is that the manufacturing support product to win orders better than its competitors. The infrastructures and process of manufacturing must be consistent with existing product order winners and flexible for future changing business needs.","The product's concept which includes shape, function, features and specifications has been chosen for further steps. The system level design focus on the product system specifications like assembly layout. Then detail design includes whole product specifications of materials, components, and standard parts from suppliers. After that, testing and refinement is about test and evaluation all preproduction aspects of product. Finally, production ramp-up phase is for training the workforce and find any existing flaws in the whole process. This phase is often a continuous step. In fact, there are many different models used in product development processes. All of them have advantages and disadvantages and are applied to different industries. This part will identify three main models: First generation process, Stage gate process and Third generation process. 2.1.1 First generation processNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) introduced the first generation product development process called Phased Project Planning in 1960s. It often has exhaustive plan of working with suppliers and subcontractors and are applied in aerospace and military industrial projects. (Cooper, 1994) It usually mentioned as Phased Review Process because of its specification.",False,701,2127,8604,8619

I spoke to the Front Office Manager who gave me the keys to a couple of rooms and told me to offer rack rate. As it was in the summer, the hotel had a very high occupancy, and they wanted connecting rooms because of the children, though, we only had two available which were not the best. I offered rack rate as I was told to, and they were disappointed; you could tell that they needed the rooms, but were not willing to pay such an amount for them (and they were right! ).They asked for a suite, but all of them were occupied so I thought about negotiating a lower rate with them as they seemed quite distressed and were staying for 11 nights.","As fixed costs alter mostly due to external factors, it is possible for the hotel to concentrate on its controllable costs, and increase its profit by increasing its sales, in comparison to costs, or boosting its revenue through cutting costs (Burgess, 2001). 3.1.12 Total P&L RatiosThe ratios in the total P&L show average figures per day, and these must be taken into account when calculating prices, or establishing strategies to cut costs.

Logical positivism also influenced psychology through it's convictions that scientific theories were about objects, processes and structures in the real world, through this psychology adopted the assumption of realism. This led to terms such as 'attitude' being referred to as real features in the world right up to the present day. Not all however shared the classical view that logical positivism influenced the development of the school of behaviourism in psychology. Smith (1986) has strongly argued against this view, claiming that logical positivism could not have influenced behaviourism, claiming that the first behaviourists such as Burrhus Skinner and Clark Hull were influenced by a naturalistic epistemology that was rooted in the works of the non-positivists such as Clarence Lewis.",This study concluded that letter knowledge did have a causal influence on subsequent phonological processing abilities. Similar support and acknowledgement of the influential relationship between letter knowledge and phonological awareness can be found in a study by Stahl and Murray (1994) who found that children with low letter knowledge also had lower abilities in phonological sensitivity tasks. In this study only 1 child of the 113 sampled (who all had low letter knowledge) was able to complete the phonological sensitivity task. Support for the theory that letter knowledge has an influence on phonological awareness also comes from several intervention studies that have specifically controlled for letter knowledge (see Bradley and Bryant (1983). These studies contain specific instruction on letter knowledge and looked at the impact of this on phonological awareness.

However, the main disc damage modes are warping, cracking and scarring, and warping is the most important thing that engineer has to take into account to determine what kind of material they are going to use, and what is the thickness of the disc. So the design parameters for the brake disc are disc velocity, brake pedal force and structural loading, such as surface moment from hub and surface pressure from pads.

Though many were involved in incidents of banditry and opportunistic abuse, the war provided indigenous participants an avenue towards greater appreciation of belonging to a wider cause. In defending a region from a foreign threat, the conflict permitted the forging of an enhanced consciousness of inter-community identities, helping to establish ""bonds of solidarity"". Practically speaking, this entailed attrition of longstanding ethnic tensions between Indian groups that had considered themselves culturally and often linguistically distinct from their neighbours, as the Túpac Amaru rebellion had achieved some one hundred years before.

1190036,"Once combustion starts the flame propagates throughout the mixed gases within the cylinder, typical burn rates for gasoline are 1.4~1.5m/s. Ignition TimingCombustion takes a finite time, therefore ignition is advanced to BTDC. This means there is a pressure rise BTDC and the compression work increases (negative work). Higher pressure at TDC leads to higher pressures during expansion and hence an increase in positive work. Therefore there is an optimum ignition timing that is a compromise between these two effects. Plotting ignition timing against torque produces a curve similar to that shown in Figure 6.1. The minimum advance is more critical than maximum advance for max torque and so is generally quoted, this is known as MBT (Minimum advance for Best Torque). By retarding the ignition by a few degrees from maximum torque the nitric oxide emission are greatly reduced, this also reduces the engines octane requirements.

The recent naked display of American unilateral action undermines the respect for international law by creating a precedent of taking the law into its own hands.

Traditionally, dividends were predominant mechanism firms used to deliver their permanent earnings, while share repurchases was relatively unimportant until mid-1980. A study conducted by Fama and French (2001) based on the US companies shows the proportion of firms paying dividends decreased sharply after 1978 (from 66.5% to 20.8% in 1999). Meanwhile, Grullon and Michaely (2002) observed there was an increasing propensity in the recent years of purchasing stocks, and the evidence shows the expenditures on shares repurchase program relative to total earnings increased dramatically from 4.8% in 1980 to 41.8% in 2000( see Figure 1). Thus, in order to understand how the firms choose one method over another, the assay will especially focus on the potential motives behind firms to distribute its retained earnings via dividends or stock repurchases. 2 Dividends PolicyA dividend is a cash payment made by the corporation to its common share holders pro rata.","In this sense, monopoly firms may be able to increase the pace of innovation and push the PPF outward through integrated technology in the comparison with perfect competitive firms, who will be incapable with zero profit in the long term. The other argument in support of business with monopoly is economies of scale as I mentioned before. Falls in long run average cost provide gains in welfare for both customers and producer, thus satisfy Pareto efficiency improvement condition. In my opinion, some of the characteristics described as monopoly are not valid anymore since the economic globalization and free trade becomes an inevitable trend. Many national monopolists have realized the threat from the whole world. Even a domestic monopoly has to make great effort to improve its productivity and efficiency in order to keep one step ahead of potential competitors from overseas. Furthermore, externality is present whenever there is spillover effect to groups rather than the decision maker, and it is the forth factor here associating with the extent of monopoly inefficiency. If the producer of externalities doesn't have the incentives to take into account the effect of their actions on the others, the outcome might cause the deviation from present Pareto efficiency.",False,1813,2143,15820,15823

A quite debatable characteristic of biological control is that it does not exterminate the pest. If it is viewed by self-perpetuation scope, this is another advantage, because the continued presence of the prey ensures the presence of the biocontrol agent and pest control system consequently is more effective. So and so, the extermination of pests is not included in the aims of biological control. As Weeden and Shelton (2005) point out: ""in general, it is accepted that the aim is to depress the pest population below the Economic Injury Level (EIL): That is where the costs of the control measures start to exceed those of the extra revenue.

The first autocratic decision procedure is based on me taking known information and making the decision alone. It is very similar to the second autocratic decision procedure, which only differs in the fact that I take the information on which I base my decision from my employees. I would use the first autocratic procedure in situations where I am confident that my knowledge and use of it is better than that of my employees, for example when selling corn to a grain trader. The second autocratic procedure is better for use in situations where I feel my employees may have a useful perspective on the situation, but due to my position as farm manager, I must ultimately make the decision.

Suckler cows and calves are the most common users of the grassed valleys as the land is highly productive and can support relatively high stocking densities. Many of the valleys are emptied of cattle over winter, due to the cold temperatures and also the timing of calving on many farms. However, sometimes sheep are then turned onto the valleys, but normally they are left to recover over the winter. Leisure alongside LivestockThe main leisure pursuits that are enjoyed over the Yorkshire Wolds are that of Foxhunting and Partridge shooting. Following on from the Enclosure Act, many plantations of trees were grown, some on valley slopes, but more often at the side of valleys. Although these are rarely used to house livestock, they became good locations for the establishment of the game birds used in shooting. In addition to these plantations, fields of Kale were also sown to act as cover for the birds.",True,1821,1190,36275,36291

This love of aggression seems a new phenomenon, but may simply be finding open expression in private written magic for the first time'. There are few means for us to prove or disprove this notion; the only course for us is to compare these texts with the older texts that have survived. It is indeed possible that such texts had existed before the Greek Magical Papyri but none have survived. Pinch also describes the main changes between the two styles of spells. Seemingly it was the ends to which the spells were used and also the motivation that changed during this period. Before the spells were generally for protection of a person, property, temple or field and healing. In the Greek Magical Papyri they are motivated by desires such as sexual pleasure or financial benefit.","(II: 42)'Nevertheless, before their time Egypt was, indeed, ruled by gods, who lived on earth amongst men, sometimes on of them, sometimes another being supreme above the rest.

Biological control is a method which is not harmful for the environment and therefore farmers should prefer to use it instead of pesticides. Waste management is extremely significant for all environmental management systems. Like every horticultural enterprise, the pepper green house produces various types of waste quantities that have to be managed. Waste could be: used packages, pesticides containers, manures, fertilizers packages, green residues, vehicle wastes and various others. An easy solution for many farmers was to burn all these wastes, or just drop them to a dump place. Environmental management schemes require from the farmers to recycle as many waste as possible. There are several options like give the waste to recycle companies, store them for a maximum of 12 months, obtain a Prevention Pollution Control (PPL) or a Waste Management License (WML) and take the waste to a recovery or disposal site.

Butlin estimates that disease halved the Aboriginal population between 1788 and 1850. The single most destructive disease was smallpox because it was highly contagious and was able to spread extraordinarily quickly amongst an indigenous population which had very limited resistance. In the accounts of the Wellington Valley Mission there is also a great deal of evidence of sexually transmitted diseases. Watson states, 'The blacks here are inflicted with the venereal in a dreadful manner, children and even infants have it very commonly."" This huge loss of Aboriginal population meant there were far fewer people to convert. Even within the time period of the Wellington Valley Mission it is apparent that there is a decreasing number of potential converts. Watson declares, 'We have lately had 70 natives here, now only about 20.""

Depth 177-173cm also yielded 4 possible pieces of worked flint.

Before investigating the fortunes of the contemporary Far Right; one must firstly understand the historical development of this movement. Christopher Husbands (1994) argues the Far Right in Britain has never been significantly popular as in the twentieth century it was never electorally successful. This begs the question of why there has never been a mass fascist movement in Britain. Moreover, why has British Far Right politics only ever had a minimal appeal and limited success? The depression in the 1930s caused political chaos and the rise of extremist politics in Europe. However, British fascist leader Oswald Mosley and his party the British Union of Fascists was never able to exploit this socio-economic crisis. However, arguably the depression was never quite as intense in Britain as it was spread over a longer period and Mosley flaws as a leader meant the fascist movement failed in this crisis.","Therefore Phillips emphasis on race is detrimental as these social groupings are interlinked and their effects are interdependent.

The main economic reason for this was that the larger commercial farms had lower costs per acre than smaller farms, and also larger farms could practice division of labour and economies of scale, enabling them to have larger profits. While this would have mattered little to a subsistence farmer, a landlord would have been concerned provided rent was linked to profit. Hence there was an incentive to increase farm sizes from the landlord's perspective Allen, (2004): p100 Note I have excluded enclosure from this reasoning, as Overton (1996): p174 has shown that there is no discernable link between enclosure and an increase in farm size. The growth in farm size has also been associated with a change in land tenure as the rich sought to take advantage of the increases in rents after the onset of enclosure. According to Chambers, rents doubled on average after enclosure as the enclosed land was more efficient, but Clark claims that the increase was much less, perhaps around 40%.","While conflict can exist, therefore, its origin should not be with management, rather it is the employees who are to blame and this helps to reassure management. As cited in Rose, E (2004:26) The pluralist perspective is more in line with modern society. It sees the organisation as being groups of individuals and that these groups have their own interests and aims, as well as leadership. It is this which gives rise to conflict as these aims and interests often differ, giving rise to tension, much like which occurs between dissenting groups outside the walls of the organisation in society. Furthermore, unlike the unitarist which sees there being only one source of authority and loyalty (that being the management), the pluralist perspective sees a multitude of sources of loyalty and authority in different groups like trade unions. Hence there is a 'constant state of dynamic tension arising from conflicts of interest and loyalty which need to be managed' (Rose, E 2004:27).

In the paper Rasmussen (2006) wrote, he goes on to conclude that the soils on individual farms present different challenges to farmers converting to organic, saying that a combination of techniques may be effective in reducing weed biomass at one location, however not effective, or to a lesser degree at another location. Therefore farmers need to plan which techniques would produce the best results, however suggestions for doing so were not mentioned. A stale seedbed is the tillage technique used to deplete the soil seed bank. This occurs by forming a tilled seedbed, but not planting a crop, and due to the disturbance of the soil weed seeds are promoted to germinate. These weeds can then be eradicated before setting seed and then the crop is drilled.","Due to the restrictions organic farmers face on inputs, problems arise in combating disease and the following from Lampkin (1990) highlights other difficulties: - Reduced yields (crops)- Reduced output/ slower growth (livestock)- Weeds- Pests- Prices of output products - Labour requirements- Fertiliser application and releaseFollowing the restructuring of the farming subsidy scheme between 2002 - 2004 (entry level, organic entry level and higher level), the options for growers to go organic has been widened and the money being provided through the subsidy, for all stewardship schemes, is better targeted towards environmental farming practices. The list of options available for farmers on the organic scheme (OELS) includes buffer zones, hedgerow management, beetle banks, under sowing cereals, and conservation headlands, Defra, (2005). It is clear from the above that the potential for biocontrol is present, as beetle banks and conservation headlands are known to host natural predators which could be exploited for control of pests in the crop, and the correct choice of species sown in the headland could attract pests out of the crop and provide alternative food for predators (Root, 1973).",True,153,1127,37830,37841

How might an increase of this protection change the outcome of the war? Since only states can be parties in the Geneva Conventions, IHL does not apply to conflicts between a state and a terrorist group.

Greenwoods (1986) inbreeding avoidance hypothesis predicts that an individual's reproductive success will be reduced at high levels of inbreeding thus promoting dispersal. The average age at first conception for a number of primate species is less than the average residence of breeding males suggesting inbreeding avoidance with fathers or close relatives among females (Clutton-Brock, 1989). Males often disperse at puberty reducing the risk of mating with close kin (Packer, 1979). Random dispersal results in a diverse migrant pool, and maximises the breeding success of the population. Non-random dispersal by young males increases genetic similarity between groups enhancing inbreeding effects as the gene pool becomes less diverse, e.g. vervet monkeys (Cheney & Seyfarth, 1983). Fraternal migration in the absence of a continued exchange of males between groups does not appear to increase inbreeding and may be purely beneficial to the migrating individual (Cords, 1986).","Thus habitat destruction exacerbates the effects of hunting and can have a dramatic impact causing primate populations to plummet (Dunbar and Cowlishaw, 2000; Struhsaker, 1997; Wright and Jernvall, 1998). Therefore primates living in disturbed, fragmented or modified forest areas are likely to be more vulnerable to the pressures of hunting. For example there have been a high number of local extinctions of the woolly monkey (Lagothrix spp.) in Havea habitats as result of the rubber tappers hunting them for food while working in the forest (Peres, 1991). Forest size and habitat heterogeneity also influence primate group size and distribution (Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 2000). Hunting and habitat loss will cause populations to decline in size. Small isolated populations are increasingly vulnerable to intrinsic factors, such as demographic and environmental stochasticity and the loss of genetic diversity (Leakey and Lewin, 1995). Except for a few exceptional cases extinction is a multi-stage process occurring patchily as populations are lost at different times and locations (Struhsaker, 1997).",False,483,2187,24834,24848

In future all medical practitioners would have to possess what were deemed to be the necessary education and examinations in order to operate legitimately and legally. Sadly for women, this Act was also the peak of their increasing exclusion from medicine. It placed a legal barrier in the path of any woman wishing to practice, because none of the nineteen possible routes of entry into the medical register possessed examinations in which women were allowed to participate. Thus, in basic terms, the professionalisation of medicine was also its masculinisation. This masculinisation of medicine cannot and should not be seen in isolation. It reflects but also perhaps aided the dominant ideology of the time which, in being influenced by 'enlightened' thinking, saw the female gender as irrational and irresponsible, ruled by passions and emotion.","This ignores the complex web of factors involved in making choices about what one eats, and is also dangerous in removing all responsibility from people like advertisers and the government, those who have the power to do something about the population's diet.

What are the implications of the legal and ethical issues that you have considered in this case for your own practice? I found it interesting when researching this assignment to realise that sectioned patients actually have clearer rights than informal ones. I found the nurse's role in scrutinising medical recommendations such as section papers(Dimond & Barker 1996) and making sure that all is correct particularly relevant since an example of this happened incorrectly whilst I was in practice. Section papers were accepted by nursing staff and it was later found that neither of the doctors was section 12 approved and therefore the section was invalid. This had major implications since meanwhile the patient was restrained which they could have used as grounds to sue the trust.,"These are found in both the Cortex and the Hippocampus which is why memory problems are often an early sign of Alzheimer's. The posterior part of the hippocampus is most badly damaged and this is why sufferers will sometimes have excellent recall of events in their early life that are stored in their long term memory. These tangles are easily identified by light microscopy during a post mortem. As well as the plaques and tangles, Mountjoy (1993) notes two other pathogenic irregularities found in the brains of sufferers: neuronal loss and deposition of amyloid. Granular vascular bodies are also found in brains during post mortem, these are an outer membrane with a small dense granule in the centre - they are found in most aged brains but more common in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The granular vascular bodies cause the brain to appear darker than a younger brain. Other things that are noticed during a post mortem is that the cortex becomes atrophied (shrunken), it can lose as much as 1/3 of its volume as the disease progresses.",False,374,1156,24998,25026

Neither the eighteenth-century philosophes, nor the revolutionaries of 1789, advocated a French republic.

By enlisting the use of such terms and ideas, these women were actively participating in the maintenance of Empire, by offering approval of their validity. There were, of course, some examples of feminist women who voiced opposition to the project of Empire. Annie Besant was able to challenge the ideology behind imperialism without compromising her desire to further the position of women. She worked tirelessly to understand native culture, thus her criticism of certain practices (such as child marriage) was well founded.

This should be placed across R C. This creates an upper cut-off due to the fact that when the frequencies are above the calculated cut-off frequency (see appendix entitled ""Calculating upper cut-off capacitor value"") the capacitor's reactance becomes very low. This causes the current to flow through the capacitor and not the resistor R C. This in turn reduces the output as the gain of the circuit is determined by the ratio of the resistance values of R C and R E. When the capacitor's reactance is low, R C is effectively low, causing the gain to decrease. Revised circuit:The circuit now meets all of the specifications bar one, the DC supply current.

Although only at a prototype stage, I have full confidence in NASA to have completed the design and testing ready for probe launch in around 2010. The engine works on three basic cells: the forward, the central and the aft cells. Hydrogen gas is injected into the forward cell and ionised to create a plasma, which is then passed into the central cell to be further heated with electromagnetic energy (radio waves), to hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius. The plasma then enters the aft cell where a magnetic nozzle converts the energy of the plasma into velocity of the jet exhaust [ref.13]. An incredibly strong magnetic field is also used to contain the plasma. In rocket science, the fuel efficiency of a rocket engine is measured by its specific impulse, which refers to the units of thrust per the units of propellant consumed over time. The great thing about this fusion reaction engine is that it can generate a specific impulse of about 300 times greater than conventional chemical engines [ref.13].","To really hit the nail on the head, by looking through his telescope (the first telescope the world had ever seen) Galileo discovered that there were moons orbiting Jupiter.

However in the same way it is important that we appreciate the gender ideologies which exist in the third world 'push' these migrant women closer to the 'pull' of the west 'care deficit' and so shape globalization in reverse. Just as western women are pressured into hiring migrant help, many third world women view migration as a chance to break away from patriarchal structures which dominate their lives.

The relationship between strategy and performance measures is analysed, and a scheme is proposed to facilitate the transfer of the latter to the former. FindingsThe findings of the research indicated that hotel managers are aware of the importance of considering their strategy when measuring performance. However, very few of them put this ideology into practice, as performance measurement in the hospitality industry is still predominantly financially based.

In addition, the focus will be on national elections as it is the most significant and common election across nations. This will facilitate the comparison of electoral systems across nations that will allow us to infer some structural differences that have encouraged or restricted voting which in turn have produced different turnout rates - high turnout rates in Malta and low turn out rates in America and Switzerland.

Against this art historical legacy the work of the Ures stands out for considering the archaeological contexts of pottery and for paying attention to ceramics that were second rate artefacts (Ure and Ure, 1954). The Haimon Painter is representative of the latest Attic black-figured pottery (ca. 500 to 450 BC) at a time when the red-figure style was well established. Haimon's notoriously 'careless' and repetitive style (Haspels, 1936) has led to claims of cheap mass production for ritual or mortuary use by the poor in Athens or for commodity trade and export (Boardman, 1974: 146ff).","Regarding the distribution of production centres, the observation that stone artefacts reached various villages in the EN and MN as partially or fully developed tools (flint blades or obsidian cores) and not as raw material has logically given rise to arguments about a few localised production centres near the raw material sources (Perlès, 1992: 128, 136-137; Perlès and Vitelli, 1999: 97). Although the operation of such specialised centres remains a possibility, their archaeological visibility appears to be problematic.

As feminist issues came to the forefront of public and even academic society, gender archaeology and its unique views and interpretations soon followed and became and increasingly important part of archaeological theory (Fagan 1996: 244). Gender archaeology at its most basic level looks at the roles of males and females, their activities, their relative positions within past societies as well as assesses the symbolic and cultural meanings attached to them throughout the whole of human history. It works on the assumption that all historical (as well as modern!) societies require a definite collaboration between men and women (Fagan 1996: 244). The main aims pursued by gender archaeologists include attempting to correct the male orientated bias that has and still does exist in archaeology; this basically means changing the assumption that all past societies were male dominated and that women were second class citizens (some gender archaeologists also try to change the use of the word 'man' when referring to humankind, a distinctly feminist sounding agenda).","It can be asserted that metalworkers were producing and manufacturing items in anticipation of demand as opposed to waiting until the items were needed, it shows that in some cases and regions a surplus was required.

Biological control is a method which is not harmful for the environment and therefore farmers should prefer to use it instead of pesticides. Waste management is extremely significant for all environmental management systems. Like every horticultural enterprise, the pepper green house produces various types of waste quantities that have to be managed. Waste could be: used packages, pesticides containers, manures, fertilizers packages, green residues, vehicle wastes and various others. An easy solution for many farmers was to burn all these wastes, or just drop them to a dump place. Environmental management schemes require from the farmers to recycle as many waste as possible. There are several options like give the waste to recycle companies, store them for a maximum of 12 months, obtain a Prevention Pollution Control (PPL) or a Waste Management License (WML) and take the waste to a recovery or disposal site.

It could be eaten cold and therefore not only saved money on expensive fuel costs of cooking, but was quick and easy to prepare- an important quality for busy mothers. Furthermore, when bread went stale, it could be toasted, it was a readily available and a relatively cheap foodstuff, it could be served at any meal and most importantly, the family liked it.

According to Wilkinson (as cited in Taylor, 2000) the cognitive skills required for critical thinking include decision making and problem solving methods. 'Problem solving involves assessing, planning, implementing and evaluating the best course of action in given situations so that the most effective care can be negotiated' (Taylor, 2000, p.14) Reflection is an important process in all of these stages. When assessing, a Health Care Professional may need to reflect on the information given to gain a better understanding of the client or situation. When planning, they may need to reflect on anything that may have not gone to plan in previous similar situations. When implementing, they may need to reflect on their practice as they undertake it. Evaluation is reflection in itself, in looking what has happened, what could be improved and what went well.

Therefore primates living in disturbed, fragmented or modified forest areas are likely to be more vulnerable to the pressures of hunting. For example there have been a high number of local extinctions of the woolly monkey (Lagothrix spp.) in Havea habitats as result of the rubber tappers hunting them for food while working in the forest (Peres, 1991). Forest size and habitat heterogeneity also influence primate group size and distribution (Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 2000). Hunting and habitat loss will cause populations to decline in size. Small isolated populations are increasingly vulnerable to intrinsic factors, such as demographic and environmental stochasticity and the loss of genetic diversity (Leakey and Lewin, 1995). Except for a few exceptional cases extinction is a multi-stage process occurring patchily as populations are lost at different times and locations (Struhsaker, 1997).","Finding additional partners to mate with, to pass on genetic material into the next generation, is a major driving force behind male dispersal strategies. Greenwoods (1986) inbreeding avoidance hypothesis predicts that an individual's reproductive success will be reduced at high levels of inbreeding thus promoting dispersal. The average age at first conception for a number of primate species is less than the average residence of breeding males suggesting inbreeding avoidance with fathers or close relatives among females (Clutton-Brock, 1989). Males often disperse at puberty reducing the risk of mating with close kin (Packer, 1979). Random dispersal results in a diverse migrant pool, and maximises the breeding success of the population. Non-random dispersal by young males increases genetic similarity between groups enhancing inbreeding effects as the gene pool becomes less diverse, e.g. vervet monkeys (Cheney & Seyfarth, 1983). Fraternal migration in the absence of a continued exchange of males between groups does not appear to increase inbreeding and may be purely beneficial to the migrating individual (Cords, 1986).",True,483,2187,24834,24848

The implication of this is that what exists is not necessarily the ideal state of things. There is much evidence to suggest that, for Bull, the ultimate political association in the anarchical states system would be a solidarist one of consensus and community. However, the achievable, ""second best"" scenario was a pluralist international society based on respect for the rule of law. Bull was 'aware that the state and the states system have emerged, evolved, are resilient, are being superseded, and will continue to evolve'. His 'sense of the future is essentially an extension in time of his interpretation of the past and present, but further sophisticated by a sceptical view of human capacity to discern future possibilities'. One could say that Bull's approach is 'self-consciously conditioned by historical circumstance, relying on an interpretive presentation of reality rather than claiming to be scientific in a positivist sense'. By essence this kind of approach is open to change and reinterpretation and Bull himself demanded it.","In the work of Hooghe and Marks there is an emphasis on the empirical verification of state sovereignty as 'diluted' by these processes.

It is apparent that the fundamental purpose of a design is to lower the risk of developing software by constructing the architecture and finding the best ways to write the most efficient and robust code possible, so the chance of the system failing when in operation is minute. Lowering risk is crucial for a business as the software driving their systems determines how well they perform in the market; the more efficient the system, the more reputable the business will be for good service. If design wasn't used to develop software for businesses then the systems may not be as reliable or such a good solution as they would otherwise have been. The essay analogy can be used again because without a design, the final product may not be as coherent or as well structured as it could have been. Although the majority of people prefer to sit down and start coding and believe that writing a design is a waste of time, it is ironic because it can actually save a lot of time in the future.","In contrast, the Token Ring architecture copes well with high traffic as collisions do not occur as nodes can only transmit when they are in possession of the token thus making it speedier than Ethernet. Token Ring is a fair network and prevents one node from hogging the network media. It doesn't allow a node that has just transmitted to transmit again in succession, and so the speed of the network is consistent at all times. Ethernet does not have a scheme like this and a node can flood the network with data and not allow others to transmit. This can be frustrating for other users as the network will appear slow. You could argue that Ethernet is more flexible than Token Ring as it can be wired as a Bus or Star topology giving you options with cabling but as prices are dropping rapidly, this is no longer becoming an issue, and the ability for a node to be added onto a bus network makes the architecture very scalable. Token Ring is stuck with the star configuration but this is standard across many architectures today, but it is not very scalable because the more nodes on the network, the less often the token is available and so sub netting is necessary.",True,478,2454,33995,34024

Instead it tends to reproduce social hierarchies, both in terms of class - with insurance-based benefits playing a significant role, and in terms of gender - with the family given huge importance as the primary source of social security. Lastly, the liberal welfare regime, which Esping-Anderson associates with the Anglo-American countries, is based on the premise that the free play of market forces generally leads to the optimal distribution of goods. Here the state plays a residual role, seeking to remedy only the worst effects of market failure. The regime-type that a country's welfare state comes to resemble is in large part determined by the configuration of power found in that country. In the early phases of industrialisation the probability of social democracy prevailing was increased when the rural-economy was dominated by small, capital-intensive family farmers (as in Scandinavia), decreased when there were large pools of cheap labour (as in much of continental Europe).","Most importantly for the Conservatives it was politically expedient as it changed the electoral landscape in that by reducing the provision of council houses they were eroding traditional Labour strongholds, with new homeowners more ideologically inclined to vote for the incumbent government. Another key principle of Conservative social policy was to tackle bureaucratic monopolies and impregnate social services with greater levels of competition. Reform was premised on the notion that any service would be more efficiently provided if it was free from administrative controls and political interference. Government support for inefficient producers simply distorts the price mechanism; and the traditional state provision of services creates monopolies not subject to the influence of patient's choice, resulting in the patient not getting the optimal treatment. Referring back to Keith Joseph's quote in the beginning of the essay it is simply unfeasible for government ministers or senior civil servants to be more receptive to the complex and ever-changing needs of the consumer as well as the market does.

A luxury hotel or restaurant, for example, will have a major part of its costs in the location, in the building itself, that is its fixed costs will be high. Consequently, it will need to achieve a greater sales volume to reach the break-even point. On the other hand, a lower scale business would have fewer costs in the infrastructure. As most of the costs will be variable, it will require a lower sales volume to achieve the break-even point, but the profits will not grow as fast since the variable costs for each transaction will be superior (Harris, 1999). High fixed cost businesses will be more market oriented, whether the low fixed cost ones will be more cost oriented.","Moreover, even though business and governmental markets are not the primary but the second target market, it is expected their demand will be substantial.

In addition, Weber proceeds to state, that even these religious ideas appear artificially simple, 'as they could at best but seldom be found in history. Ephraim Fischoff concludes in his critique of Weber's Protestant Ethic, Weber's general view remained that 'human affairs are infinitely complicated, with numerous elements interacting; and it was his unshakable conviction that to attribute casual primacy is to be guilty of oversimplification.""

913208,"In the field of microcontrollers manufacturing, the method of CPA is used in a slightly more complex way to deal with the complex project of microcontroller manufacture. Like in the case of any other real project, the main idea of the programmer is to reduce the time to complete each of the tasks and in turn manufacture the microprocessor chip more quickly and at a minimal cost. During the process of the chip manufacture, the tasks that lie on the critical path are known as critical instructions, and the remaining tasks that are not related to the critical path are known as non-critical instructions (Tune, 2004). It has been further identified that to conclude the critical path of chip manufacturing is not as easy as expected. They need to firstly identify the essential hardware required, followed by predicting how it would improve or enhance the functioning of the chip and finally Control the behaviour of the processor at the micro architectural level using those predictions. These processes are known as Critical- Path Aware Processor Architectures. The introduction of CPA into the manufacturing of chips has considerably saved time for the programmer.","This is done because, it is understood and can be realised that the teaching staff is related to certain modules which in turn are related to the departments.

Firms are quick to point out that purchasing should only consider suppliers capable of meeting rigid quality standards. Price by itself should not be the sole criterion for a souring decision. Assessing the need for global sourcingNot all firms should commit the time and resources to develop integrated procurement systems. For example, a smaller manufacturer competing in regional markets against other regional producers probably does not have the need or capability to pursue anything beyond basic international purchasing. A firm with a single design and manufacturing facility will not require sophisticated global sourcing systems. A firm must assess the level of international or global sourcing required to remain competitive in its industry. The level required is a function of four variables: competitive forces, customer requirements, level of global competition, and the location of the best suppliers for the specific purchase requirement. Once a firm identifies its deport that level and identify its current sourcing capabilities. Identifying the operating requirements and current capabilities helps highlight any potential performance gaps between where a firm is and where it should be.","Paradoxically, many companies that have adopted lean manufacturing as a business practice are anything but agile in their supply chain.

Essentially, the intensification of the fear and demonizing of the enemy blinded many to the true and limited extent of the Soviet threat during the Cold War.

This backlash arises when we placed all fundamentalist ideologies, movements and groups under the same branch of ""Islam"" and perceived it as a threat in its totality. This serves to alienate even the most moderate Islamist groups, such as the Muslim Brotherhood which aspires to reform society according to Islamic laws with a just cause without infringing on the rights of others. In effect, seeing ""Islam"" as a threat accentuates the ""bloody borders""  between the ""West"" and ""Islam"" more evidently.","Consequently, the law is an act of sovereignty and an expression of the general will, which is not to be confused with the government whose sole legitimate function is to administer not make laws.

In 1993 there were 12 member states which soon became 15 and then on June 1 st 2004 10 new members joined the EU. Further expansion seems inevitable but what is the rationale and main aims behind this reasoning for the creation of an EU single market? Fundamentally the rationale for the EU single market is the creation of free and fair trade between its member states. This could occur through removal of duties or governments not giving unfair advantages to domestic produces. Further, there are 4 freedoms of movement that encompass the single market; goods, labour, capital and services. The Treaty on European Union (1991) outlined a 3 stage development of the single market; liberalisation of capital movements and alignment of currencies in Exchange Rate Mechanism, economic convergence of member countries and finally the introduction of single currency and Economic Monetary Union (based on member state assessment).","once a week) combined with quarterly reviews of progress would increase communications and let each department director know how the other departments where getting on.

I would say that, this is very true in most African societies. Where mothers-in-law controls the activities of daughters-in-law, in case of participation in women's movement, some young women are not involved, and so will not benefit from such programmes, either as a result of instructions by the mother-in-law to stay behind and prepare food, or due to the burden of household chores. To ensure success in mobilization groups need to deal with issues experienced by poor and non-poor women to ensure inclusiveness. To encourage poor women to participate in group activities, such as micro credit schemes, implementing organisations need to modify the rules, so as to allow women who cannot save at all or who can save only small amounts to join and introduce additional savings for the better-off women (Murthy, 2004:15), as in the case of women farmers in Uganda.","In the process of marital exchange, the study finds that women do compare their gendered resources with those of their husbands. A failure of a husband to fulfil the provider role may increase the value of his wife's resources, while reducing his own, leaving his wife with a sense of unfairness on his part. All this depends on how resources are defined within the household (Zuo and Bian, 2001), and how women have been socialized to combine their waged work effectively with household work, this could actually explain why, full time working women still perform a large share of domestic work in order to maintain an accepted gender regime within the household. Baxter's research found that women spend 24hours per week on housework compared to 9hours per week for men. Similarly in relation to childcare, women report spending more than twice as much time on childcare than men.

The other argument in support of business with monopoly is economies of scale as I mentioned before. Falls in long run average cost provide gains in welfare for both customers and producer, thus satisfy Pareto efficiency improvement condition. In my opinion, some of the characteristics described as monopoly are not valid anymore since the economic globalization and free trade becomes an inevitable trend. Many national monopolists have realized the threat from the whole world. Even a domestic monopoly has to make great effort to improve its productivity and efficiency in order to keep one step ahead of potential competitors from overseas. Furthermore, externality is present whenever there is spillover effect to groups rather than the decision maker, and it is the forth factor here associating with the extent of monopoly inefficiency. If the producer of externalities doesn't have the incentives to take into account the effect of their actions on the others, the outcome might cause the deviation from present Pareto efficiency.","Introduction This assay is to investigate firms' decisions to distribute cash flow and their choices between paying out in the form of dividends or stock repurchases. Traditionally, dividends were predominant mechanism firms used to deliver their permanent earnings, while share repurchases was relatively unimportant until mid-1980. A study conducted by Fama and French (2001) based on the US companies shows the proportion of firms paying dividends decreased sharply after 1978 (from 66.5% to 20.8% in 1999). Meanwhile, Grullon and Michaely (2002) observed there was an increasing propensity in the recent years of purchasing stocks, and the evidence shows the expenditures on shares repurchase program relative to total earnings increased dramatically from 4.8% in 1980 to 41.8% in 2000( see Figure 1).

The creators of PBL intended change of a hitherto unprecedented level- from how students perceived their role in the educative process, how their teachers or 'facilitators' provided education and guidance, even to the extent of how the individual reflected on the society they were training to serve, and indeed how society judged the practice of medicine and medical education.

1386283,"In contrast, the Token Ring architecture copes well with high traffic as collisions do not occur as nodes can only transmit when they are in possession of the token thus making it speedier than Ethernet. Token Ring is a fair network and prevents one node from hogging the network media. It doesn't allow a node that has just transmitted to transmit again in succession, and so the speed of the network is consistent at all times. Ethernet does not have a scheme like this and a node can flood the network with data and not allow others to transmit. This can be frustrating for other users as the network will appear slow. You could argue that Ethernet is more flexible than Token Ring as it can be wired as a Bus or Star topology giving you options with cabling but as prices are dropping rapidly, this is no longer becoming an issue, and the ability for a node to be added onto a bus network makes the architecture very scalable. Token Ring is stuck with the star configuration but this is standard across many architectures today, but it is not very scalable because the more nodes on the network, the less often the token is available and so sub netting is necessary.","Money is pumped into contingency plans to reduce or preferably avoid risk such as using back up power supplies if mains power fails on servers or by having hardware which outperforms the requirements of the software so it can cope with heavy traffic.

Lowering risk is crucial for a business as the software driving their systems determines how well they perform in the market; the more efficient the system, the more reputable the business will be for good service. If design wasn't used to develop software for businesses then the systems may not be as reliable or such a good solution as they would otherwise have been. The essay analogy can be used again because without a design, the final product may not be as coherent or as well structured as it could have been. Although the majority of people prefer to sit down and start coding and believe that writing a design is a waste of time, it is ironic because it can actually save a lot of time in the future.",False,478,2454,33995,34024

Manufacturers also need to take some responsibility as the way they make and process food often affects its nutrient content. As Tansey and Worsley point out, for example, 'Sodium intake is generally beyond the control of individual consumers' because salt is added to common foods like bread (1995, p.54).

Evidence is also mounting concerning the links between low socio-economic status and 'eating badly'.

Sadly for women, this Act was also the peak of their increasing exclusion from medicine. It placed a legal barrier in the path of any woman wishing to practice, because none of the nineteen possible routes of entry into the medical register possessed examinations in which women were allowed to participate.

In addition Nickelsburg comments that some of the descriptions of Wisdom are 'beholden to Stoic conceptions'. However the personification of Wisdom which extends from 6:12 to 9:18 is not believed to be a solely Greek concept. Murphy explains that the description of the order Wisdom brings is paralleled in the Egyptian concept of Ma'at; while Nickelsburg states that the language used in praise of Wisdom are most likely drawn from the praises of Isis.

Appendix C shows the TTT diagram and related C-curves for the steel BS EN12. As can be seen from this diagram, a cooling rate of approximately 250°C/second is required to miss the nose of the C-curve, and therefore achieve 100% martensite. As the cooling rate reduces the microstructure changes, indicated by the transformation lines. Note that for martensite to form the steel must be cooled to ~330°C indicated by the Ms line. To achieve 90% martensite (M90 line) the steel must be cooled to ~290°C. To achieve 50% martensite a cooling rate of approximately 12-14°C/s is required.

Ignition TimingCombustion takes a finite time, therefore ignition is advanced to BTDC. This means there is a pressure rise BTDC and the compression work increases (negative work). Higher pressure at TDC leads to higher pressures during expansion and hence an increase in positive work. Therefore there is an optimum ignition timing that is a compromise between these two effects. Plotting ignition timing against torque produces a curve similar to that shown in Figure 6.1. The minimum advance is more critical than maximum advance for max torque and so is generally quoted, this is known as MBT (Minimum advance for Best Torque). By retarding the ignition by a few degrees from maximum torque the nitric oxide emission are greatly reduced, this also reduces the engines octane requirements. FERGUSON.",False,348,1097,27219,27362

In conclusion then, I would argue that while social control has become an important and certainly present function of modern medicine, perhaps to use the term 'prime' in relation to it is to over-emphasise the coercive nature of medicine as an institution.

Furthermore, the sophisticated interpretations of some influential historians will add weight to the analysis and in an attempt to show the correlation between Leninism and Bolshevism Nikolai Bukharin and Evgenii Preobrazhensky's ABC of Communism will offer a wealth of information.

However it should be noted that although the sample was considered representative of stroke inpatients in the sub-acute phase of care (Nyberg, 1997) the study was limited as the prediction factors were only tested on the data from which they originated; thus to achieve validity the predictors would need to be tested prospectively.

The list of options available for farmers on the organic scheme (OELS) includes buffer zones, hedgerow management, beetle banks, under sowing cereals, and conservation headlands, Defra, (2005). It is clear from the above that the potential for biocontrol is present, as beetle banks and conservation headlands are known to host natural predators which could be exploited for control of pests in the crop, and the correct choice of species sown in the headland could attract pests out of the crop and provide alternative food for predators (Root, 1973).","The single use of one of the above weed control measures would not avert weed problems but conversely the use of a number of techniques in a holistic approach would achieve the best results, due to some of the processes above suppressing weed seed germination and emergence (stale seedbed and seed rates), and other processes removing the weed seeds that have emerged (Inter-row hoeing and harrowing). In the paper Rasmussen (2006) wrote, he goes on to conclude that the soils on individual farms present different challenges to farmers converting to organic, saying that a combination of techniques may be effective in reducing weed biomass at one location, however not effective, or to a lesser degree at another location.

Indeed, as Giddens (1979, cited in Bury, 1982) has noted, it is the disruption itself which reveals the taken-for-granted assumptions in everyday routine settings. Chronic illness exposes the sufferer to worlds of knowledge and experience outside of their own world of experience (Bury, 1997). These experiences, for example death, pain and suffering may be known only as distanced concepts or as realities belonging to others. Chronic illness, however, may bring these distanced ideas into reality for the sufferer, creating what Giddens has termed a 'critical situation', or a major disruptive experience.

It was his skills as a communicator that extracted the information necessary to learn of the internal divisions among the native population, information that he then exploited to the greatest European advantage.

Prescott, Conquest of Mexico, Vol. 1, p.215 Prescott, Conquest of Mexico, Vol. 2, p.363 Perhaps the most obvious advantage that lay before the invaders was their vast military superiority in terms of weaponry and formations. As Elliott indicates, the horse provided the Spanish with both a greater mobility and, at least initially, the opportunity to surprise and unsettle their enemies. Even though Cortés and his men were poorly equipped by the standards of the day (having set out on a mission of exploration not conquest) this was still a war between the 'world of iron and gunpowder in collision with the world of stone'.","There are many examples of dissent from the expected forms of behaviour, such as non-compliance with drug taking for or heavy drinking, which may not even be socially condemned if they occur among particular groups. Indeed perhaps even if we admit that social control is an important function of modern medicine, it does not necessarily have to be a negative one, as medicalisation can result in health improvements, such as declining maternal death during childbirth. In conclusion then, I would argue that while social control has become an important and certainly present function of modern medicine, perhaps to use the term 'prime' in relation to it is to over-emphasise the coercive nature of medicine as an institution. Seeing medicine's primary function as the control of social beings is to deny them their ability to negotiate the boundaries of medicalisation and the moral discourse surrounding health.",True,69,2341,13480,13527

Based on this definition, it is logical to conclude that the organizations' effectiveness is directly related to human behaviour, as organizations are made of people. But how people and different interests can affect an organization' goals and the activities required to achieve them? Is the external market interaction fundamental for the survival of an organization?

Besides, by undermining the death penalty, we undermine the lives of those who have been murdered by criminals who were far more deserving to live than criminals who volunteered to assume the risk of receiving a legal punishment that he could have avoided by not commuting a crime.

We will also examine the generator characteristics represented as a graph plot of the relationship between I (current delivered to the load), and ω (the rate of rotation in rpm) for constant voltages E. 2. Methodology 2.1 TheoryThe efficiency of a wind turbine in extracting energy from the wind can be represented by a coefficient of performance, C p.

This could occur through removal of duties or governments not giving unfair advantages to domestic produces. Further, there are 4 freedoms of movement that encompass the single market; goods, labour, capital and services.

For those families outside of the suburban experience, its governing ideals and impact on an emergent mass culture greatly influenced contemporary modes of behaviour. In its emphasis on women's importance as consumers, suburban domesticity propagated an updated model of conventional gender roles.

As cited in Rose, E (2004:26) The pluralist perspective is more in line with modern society. It sees the organisation as being groups of individuals and that these groups have their own interests and aims, as well as leadership. It is this which gives rise to conflict as these aims and interests often differ, giving rise to tension, much like which occurs between dissenting groups outside the walls of the organisation in society. Furthermore, unlike the unitarist which sees there being only one source of authority and loyalty (that being the management), the pluralist perspective sees a multitude of sources of loyalty and authority in different groups like trade unions. Hence there is a 'constant state of dynamic tension arising from conflicts of interest and loyalty which need to be managed' (Rose, E 2004:27). Therefore, conflict is both rational and inevitable, meaning it is always a consideration in MER. The pluralist manager will recognise that these conflicts can only be solved by the establishment of procedures which lead to compromise.","Following the decrease in population around 1445, the average size of farms increased and by 1700, the average farm was 65 acres in 1700 and by 1800 it was 150 acres in the South and 100 acres in the North according to estate surveys. The main economic reason for this was that the larger commercial farms had lower costs per acre than smaller farms, and also larger farms could practice division of labour and economies of scale, enabling them to have larger profits. While this would have mattered little to a subsistence farmer, a landlord would have been concerned provided rent was linked to profit. Hence there was an incentive to increase farm sizes from the landlord's perspective Allen, (2004): p100 Note I have excluded enclosure from this reasoning, as Overton (1996): p174 has shown that there is no discernable link between enclosure and an increase in farm size. The growth in farm size has also been associated with a change in land tenure as the rich sought to take advantage of the increases in rents after the onset of enclosure. According to Chambers, rents doubled on average after enclosure as the enclosed land was more efficient, but Clark claims that the increase was much less, perhaps around 40%.",True,2396,451,10233,10295

This creates an upper cut-off due to the fact that when the frequencies are above the calculated cut-off frequency (see appendix entitled ""Calculating upper cut-off capacitor value"") the capacitor's reactance becomes very low. This causes the current to flow through the capacitor and not the resistor R C. This in turn reduces the output as the gain of the circuit is determined by the ratio of the resistance values of R C and R E. When the capacitor's reactance is low, R C is effectively low, causing the gain to decrease. Revised circuit:The circuit now meets all of the specifications bar one, the DC supply current.

Monitoring side effects of atypical antipsychotic and ensuring that the client is compliant with medication is another intervention which happens during visits to the client.

Design / Methodology / ApproachA wide range of literature is used to provide the reader with a definition of performance measurement, strategy and with the key measures and models used in the hospitality business. The relationship between strategy and performance measures is analysed, and a scheme is proposed to facilitate the transfer of the latter to the former. FindingsThe findings of the research indicated that hotel managers are aware of the importance of considering their strategy when measuring performance. However, very few of them put this ideology into practice, as performance measurement in the hospitality industry is still predominantly financially based. The research has shown Bullen and Rockart's Critical Success Factor can be combined with a performance measurement framework to ensure strategy is clearly integrated in the chosen key performance measures.

In addition, the focus will be on national elections as it is the most significant and common election across nations.

Although the operation of such specialised centres remains a possibility, their archaeological visibility appears to be problematic. The EN site of Agios Petros on an islet in the Northern Sporades yielded large amounts of Melian obsidian which could suggest that Agios Petros served as an intermediary site and exported obsidian to Thessaly. Efstratiou (1985: 74) though reinterpreted the alleged obsidian workshop identified by Theocharis at Agios Petros as the in situ debris from just one core.","Background to research (previous issues, questions, theoretical and methodological approaches; previous research and achievements, limitations and opportunities for future research; justification of the projectThe study of Greek vases has been one of the main preoccupations of classical archaeology.

Against this art historical legacy the work of the Ures stands out for considering the archaeological contexts of pottery and for paying attention to ceramics that were second rate artefacts (Ure and Ure, 1954). The Haimon Painter is representative of the latest Attic black-figured pottery (ca. 500 to 450 BC) at a time when the red-figure style was well established. Haimon's notoriously 'careless' and repetitive style (Haspels, 1936) has led to claims of cheap mass production for ritual or mortuary use by the poor in Athens or for commodity trade and export (Boardman, 1974: 146ff).",True,14,2595,29673,29775

Currently, this so-called ""rogue state"" simply has no incentive to reform given the strategic climate. While it is tempting to succumb to a kind of ivory-tower hubris, a scholarly understanding of the nature of the conflict does not automatically prescribe for the implementation of a radical new policy, even if it appears that one might be needed. Clearly, there are immense domestic and international constraints that often limit even the best of intentions.

Phthalocyanines are heterolytic macrocycles consisting of four coplanar nitrogen atoms and a conjugated -system. Porphyrins that are more difficult to synthesis compared to phthalocyanines consist of the same structure as phthalocyanines but with the N bridging replaced by CH bridging, and they can be described as alkyl-substituted derivatives of porphin. Both Phthalocyanines and porphyrins are highly sort after and investigated as both molecules exhibit great structural variety, have the ability to coordinate, a large diversity of complex forms, and unusual structures and properties. Porphyrin also has potential to become the base of many catalysts in many major industrial and chemical processes. Manganese specifically has a remarkable thermal stability and has the ability to be sublimed at high temperatures.","This is particularly useful in reversible networks with the bonding also being highly adjustable as it means that control can be asserted over its structure with the degree of association, degree of branching and the distance between cross-links all able to be modified by changes to the polymers environment. The thermal and mechanical properties of reversibly cross-liked supramolecular polymers based on bifunctional and trifunctional telechelic polyesters using units of 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone as end groups were investigated. Firstly macromonomers were prepared by reacting both polycaprolactone diol and polycaprolactone triol with an isocyanate-functionalised 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone derivative. The polycaprolactone diol is a waxy solid whereas its polymer is a strong and elastic material, and the polycaprolactone triol is a sticky paste when found at room temperature but its polymer forms a strong semi-crystalline material. Other differences were observed when the original polyesters and their polymers went under thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).",True,842,2666,33299,33357

This demonstrated that while in some accommodation, which was so cramped it made it almost impossible for the Indians to maintain their caste rituals, the immigrants altered their housing to recreate a more traditional Indian or Chinese home. Both furnished their housing with items such as rugs, drapes, and curtains that resembled a home away from home far from being in accordance of European tastes.

Japanese expansionism is no exception and it too must be explained vis-à-vis the contemporary political interpretation of the national interest. In this sense, the Meiji era in Japanese history can be regarded as the beginning of the modern Japanese concept of national security which defined the political agenda. It was at this time that the Korean peninsula was referred to as a ""dagger pointed at the heart of Japan"". Japanese imperialism was conceptualised in realpolitik terms of national survival. In a desperate attempt to modernise, or else succumb to the Great Powers, the attainment of territory and wealth was assumed to be an urgent requirement.

These two different gross solution structures will exhibit different interactions and hence exhibit different properties, such as viscosity. At low sheer rates the molecules do not align up, but instead resist the applied shear force through an responsive stress (ie., a disordered phase). This stress varies linearly with applied shear, until a critical point at which molecular alignment begins to occur. This is the AB plateau region of graphs 1, 2 & 3. Across the span of this plateau, the percentage alignment increases until a second critical shear rate is reached, at which point the solution is composed entirely of aligned molecules (aligned phase).

Donne entreats the Jews to show him equal ferocity to that bravely endured by Christ, but the poet suggests that, to 'buffet, and scoffe, scourge, and crucifie' (2) him would not be a gross injustice but a fair penalty for a man who doesn't fail to crucify Christ daily in thanks for his sacrifice to mankind.","The imbalance in their relationship means that Tesman will forever be indebted to her. He struggles financially to provide everything she wants in the house because he would not want to disappoint his wife and never asserts any masculine authority over her in fear that she would rebel. She constantly pushes the boundaries of his tolerance by behaving rudely to his family and refusing to spend time with him.

One day, the world's supplies of coal and gas will run out, and other means will have to be found to supply our power. Not only this, but the burning of fossil fuels to create energy is also harmful to the environment. The burning contributes towards global warming, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, then it's predicted the world's average temperature will increase by 2ºc over the next 100 years (Webster, 2000). This temperature rise will change the global climate, making some parts of the world into arid desert, whilst other parts will be inundated with rain.

These two different gross solution structures will exhibit different interactions and hence exhibit different properties, such as viscosity. At low sheer rates the molecules do not align up, but instead resist the applied shear force through an responsive stress (ie., a disordered phase). This stress varies linearly with applied shear, until a critical point at which molecular alignment begins to occur. This is the AB plateau region of graphs 1, 2 & 3. Across the span of this plateau, the percentage alignment increases until a second critical shear rate is reached, at which point the solution is composed entirely of aligned molecules (aligned phase). As the temperature is raised, the solubility of both block sections decreases, but the polypropylene more so. The reduction in solvation encourages micellation and so the rods elongate.","By means of a Hammett pKa analysis [31] of different R 4 and R 5 substituents and Henderson-Hasselbach ionisation degree calculation [], appropriate side groups were determined that could bias the tautomerisation equilibrium towards the aforementioned active N1 tautomer, which thusly raised the physiological activity [31].

As can be seen from the graph below, when AD curve is vertical, shift in the Aggregate Supply curve does not change the equilibrium outcome. Paul Krugman:Ibid. P.12 Therefore it is the demand side policies that can affect and bring the economy out of the slowdown. Money supply as such, however, is not sufficient to move the AD curve, when the economy is in a liquidity trap, as was the case in Japan from 1996 to 2000. During this time Japan's central bank increased money supply by 40%, but this resulted in only 3% increase in the Gross Domestic Product, and it has been argued that after this monetary expansion Japan was still not at her natural level of unemployment or output. One possible way to help the economy out of the slump, when the economy is closed and the people are assumed to display adaptive expectations is to use fiscal policy.","Investment and Interest ratesOur task is to propose a model that provides a theoretical rationale linking two economic variables and investigate their relationship. The two variables we have chosen are investment and  interest rates. In finding time series data for these variables we used gross fixed capital formation for investment and interest rates on 10-year government bonds for interest rates. Gross fixed capital formation is the addition to capital stock minus depreciation. Interest rates on 10-year government bonds were used because they represent interest rates over a time period sufficient for completion of investment projects. The countries we chose for analysis are the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Denmark, all members of the EU and OECD.

This process of homogenization was also necessary to unify religious practise and celebration in Guyana. This signified a loss of a great amount of cultural diversity within their community.

Consequently the reader can compare and evaluate the arguments of both the Sunni and Shia schools of thought. However one of the major limitations of this article is its confusing and rather ineffective organisation in relation to subtopics.

It was the beginning of the 19 th century and industrial development was at its peak bringing along with it many socio-economic and demographic changes. Hence as one commentator writes, ""By the mid-nineteenth century, the law was struggling to catch up with a rate of change which was accelerating..."" This meant that the rapid industrialization far exceeded any proposed advancement or reform of law, which necessarily led to a disproportionate legal system. The latter was not adapted to the changes in society and as such could not cope with the amount of litigation put forward in the courts; the Court of Chancery. This dire situation is reflected in Dickens's Bleak House which was an illustration of the injustices, delay and expense of the law in the Court of Chancery.

Not only this, but the burning of fossil fuels to create energy is also harmful to the environment. The burning contributes towards global warming, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, then it's predicted the world's average temperature will increase by 2ºc over the next 100 years (Webster, 2000).

In this process of ""making sense"" of the social stimuli around us, we draw upon previous experience, thus arriving at 'a series of commonsense constructs [which we] have pre-selected and pre-interpreted [from] this world which [we] experience as the reality of their daily lives' (Schutz in Coulter 1979: 9).

In the essay, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada accused the central government in the metropolitan centre of cultivating city values at the cost of the 'countryside, which is full of truth and life'. Minority immigrant groups, faced by the dominance and lack of understanding of the overwhelmingly Catholic Hispanic cultural majority, attempted to secure themselves a place within the Argentine identity.

It could be argued that the society created, and therefore Morvern, is simply amoral, rendering her innocent, blameless and unaware of any harmful consequences of her actions. However, I would argue that our individual consciences would point us to the distinction between right and wrong. If someone were to sadistically rape, beat and cut up a young child, then it would take great courage (or lack of courage) for an individual to claim no objective wrongdoing. Our objective ability to see a clear wrong action indicates an objective moral standard that is not controlled by the individual or the state. I grant that perception and recognition of wrong actions may become increasingly unknowable, as in Morvern's case, but I think that is a self inflicted state to begin with, as one persistently disregards one's conscience. Morvern may well be a product of her society, but that does not render her or her society innocent.","Although the Bible is using the word to mean the nation's rejection of God in terms of a marriage relationship, I think Hardy is using it to suggest that literal adultery might be at the root of the D'Urbervilles decline and therefore God's revenge upon adultery and sexual promiscuity.

The two variables we have chosen are investment and  interest rates. In finding time series data for these variables we used gross fixed capital formation for investment and interest rates on 10-year government bonds for interest rates. Gross fixed capital formation is the addition to capital stock minus depreciation. Interest rates on 10-year government bonds were used because they represent interest rates over a time period sufficient for completion of investment projects. The countries we chose for analysis are the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Denmark, all members of the EU and OECD. We have collected quarterly time series data for the period 1992-2003 as shown below: Theoretical modelInvestment spending by firms depends on two factors: the level of sales and the real interest rate.

Reuse of captured runoff water may ideally reduce fresh water consumption during production of nursery crops. As Beeson et al. (2004), point out, modern laws and regulations in U.S.A. require reduction of fresh underground water or public surface waters used by nurseries. Stricter regulations are also currently limit nutrient concentration in water leaving nurseries (nursery runoff). The construction of runoff collection and storage basins is strongly recommended to deal with the requirements of these regulations because the reuse of irrigation waters reduces the volume of fresh water used for irrigation and limits the release of nutrients and pesticides to the environment. On the other hand, recycling of runoff concentrates soluble salts, increasing salinity to levels that irrigation water is unacceptable for ornamental production. Constructed wetlands (gravel or bog wetlands for the filtration of nursery runoff water) may provide a simple, low technology method for reducing nutrient concentrations and improving runoff water quality.

The colony of New England, however, was created for completely different reasons. It was designed primarily as a religious utopia, and its people had no thought to economic advancement. The Pilgrims sought freedom from religious persecution in both England and then Holland, and believed America would give them a fresh start. The Puritans disliked Catholic aspects still embedded within Anglicanism in England, and believed that a separation of church and state was necessary. They were committed to the beliefs of the Church of England and hoped to create their own religious ideal in New England. They also migrated to avoid increased persecution from the new Archbishop of Canterbury. Therefore, neither the Pilgrims nor the Puritans migrated to New England for economic reasons.","This shows how much of a threat Calvinism became to the Catholic Church in France in the second half of the sixteenth century.

Yet with his death, his influence upon the world proved to have only begun."" This allowed Calvinism to break its highly restrictive links with Geneva, meaning that it could spread unhindered throughout the rest of Europe. It allowed the movement to develop independent of its founder and, and thus establish its own character. Indeed, by 1591 Calvinism had made huge gains throughout Europe, and its gains here seemingly coincided both with its declining influence in Geneva and the death of Calvin. Ibid, p. 196 As stated previously, his disciples were highly important in the spread of the movement.

Since Watson and Crick's 1953 discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, 'the new genetics' has emerged as one of the most profoundly exciting and promising fields for medical research to date (Conrad and Gabe, 1999). Scientists are now able to specify the precise location of 'faulty' genes to demonstrate the aetiology of certain conditions and also to screen foetuses, with the ultimate goal being the total elimination of the genetic 'fault'. Genetic screening in itself however, raises many uncomfortable ethical issues. Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), arguably the most controversial form of genetic screening, combines two technologies, (IVF and genetic testing) with fertilisation taking place artificially in a laboratory, and the resulting embryo being screened for genetic faults prior to re-implantation in the womb.","Bury's (1982) interviews with people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, for example, found that the image of arthritis as a condition affecting the elderly made the acceptance of the condition difficult for younger respondents as the condition seemed to entail a 'premature ageing' (Singer, 1974, cited in Bury, 1982), Arthritis was seen...as a 'wear and tear' disease, a consequence of becoming old with inevitable disabling consequences, particularly expressed in fears of seizing-up and becoming crippled. Individuals, even in their forties and fifties, did not think arthritis as occurring in the way they experienced, and this was even more true for the women in their twenties.

190947,"Most importantly for the Conservatives it was politically expedient as it changed the electoral landscape in that by reducing the provision of council houses they were eroding traditional Labour strongholds, with new homeowners more ideologically inclined to vote for the incumbent government. Another key principle of Conservative social policy was to tackle bureaucratic monopolies and impregnate social services with greater levels of competition. Reform was premised on the notion that any service would be more efficiently provided if it was free from administrative controls and political interference. Government support for inefficient producers simply distorts the price mechanism; and the traditional state provision of services creates monopolies not subject to the influence of patient's choice, resulting in the patient not getting the optimal treatment. Referring back to Keith Joseph's quote in the beginning of the essay it is simply unfeasible for government ministers or senior civil servants to be more receptive to the complex and ever-changing needs of the consumer as well as the market does. Employing this rationale, the Conservative government initiated modest reforms; permitting hospitals and other important service providers to become organizationally and financially autonomous and to be run as independent trusts.","However, in contrast to the social democratic welfare state, social policy is not underpinned by the principle of solidarity nor does it try to narrow divisions in wealth. Instead it tends to reproduce social hierarchies, both in terms of class - with insurance-based benefits playing a significant role, and in terms of gender - with the family given huge importance as the primary source of social security. Lastly, the liberal welfare regime, which Esping-Anderson associates with the Anglo-American countries, is based on the premise that the free play of market forces generally leads to the optimal distribution of goods. Here the state plays a residual role, seeking to remedy only the worst effects of market failure. The regime-type that a country's welfare state comes to resemble is in large part determined by the configuration of power found in that country. In the early phases of industrialisation the probability of social democracy prevailing was increased when the rural-economy was dominated by small, capital-intensive family farmers (as in Scandinavia), decreased when there were large pools of cheap labour (as in much of continental Europe).",True,481,2195,4621,4627

How might an increase of this protection change the outcome of the war?

"", Corporate Watch Report 2006, available at  URL  (last visited, April 21, 2007). Another issue related to practical implementation of corporate social responsibility is the lack of corporate social responsibility related management tools. Businesses utilize financial management tools to make decisions in allocating their resources, such as cash, time and personnel. However, the same tools are rendered obsolete in assessing intangible concepts such as stakeholder interests. Without better analytic tools to formulate corporate social responsibility decisions, managers could only resort to their personal common sense in making decisions. The lack of general principles will be highlighted when managers are faced with competing stakeholder interests. P. Godfrey & N. Hatch, ""Researching Corporate social responsibility: An Agenda for the 21st Century"", Journal of Business Ethics (2007) 70:87-98, at 94. Ibid, at 94.

The term 'East Asia' will be employed throughout this essay to imply a region including both the nations of northeast and southeast Asia, 'China, Japan, South Korea and the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'. Nations to the north, south, west, or in the centre of Asia, or supposedly 'non-Asian' nations with an interest in the region such as Australia and the United States, are not included in this definition of East Asia, Takashi Terada, 'Constructing an ""East Asian"" Concept and Growing Regional Identity: From EAEC to ASEAN+3', The Pacific Review, Vol.16, No.2 (2003), p.252. When the latter, 'non-Asian' states are included in relation to the region, the term 'Pacific Asia' will be used. The implication of this second distinction is that cross-Pacific issues which impact on East Asia and vice-versa are entering into the discussion.","In the quest to discover the essential nature of the nexus between Lenin's political rule and theory it will be necessary to consult a variety of his writings to gain an insight into the development of his thought. What may become clear with a close reading is that there are some core principles that remained unchanged throughout his life in contrast to other immediate and improvised policies that he latched onto or jettisoned at will, according to circumstance. Furthermore, the sophisticated interpretations of some influential historians will add weight to the analysis and in an attempt to show the correlation between Leninism and Bolshevism Nikolai Bukharin and Evgenii Preobrazhensky's ABC of Communism will offer a wealth of information. Despite the limited chronological framework it will be of seminal importance to assess prominent works from the formative period prior to the February Revolution in order to witness how his thinking deviated from or remained true to his early beliefs. Wartime thoughts on The War and Russian Social Democracy and his speech in January 1917 on the twelfth anniversary of ""Bloody Sunday"" will provide an insight into Lenin's revolutionary physiognomy and his socialist outlook in the immediate run up to revolution.",False,2073,1317,13912,14120

Once slaughtered, the beef carcasses had a linear increase in carcass size with a significantly higher killing-out percentage as the amount of maize increased in the diet. The daily carcass gain of the steers fed maize silage was approximately 285g more than the grass silage-fed steers. These results would indicate that the use of maize silage increases the liveweight and carcass gain of finishing beef steers when compared to those fed on a whole grass silage. Tissue gainsTable 5 shows the depositions of lean muscle, fat deposition and bone growth over the experimental period. Numerically, there is a negative trend in lean muscle gain as a total gain per day, when the amount of grass silage decreases. This would show that less lean tissue growth occurs with the inclusion of maize silage in the diet.","Coppicing the south-facing trees around the pond area will allow light into the pond, allowing for more plant life to grow, and provide habitats for flies and waterborne insects. The Daubenton's bat almost exclusively feeds over water sources (Battersby, 2005), so allowing enough manoeuvrability for bats to enter and leave the area over water should provide sufficient space for other species, such as birds to feel secure on the pond during the day. As the north of the farm is on the Thames floodplain, it may be possible to establish a reed bed in the Shacklefords. The reed bed could allow the introduction of a new habitat for water voles, shrews and mice. The bed also provides shelter against stoats, weasels and polecats that might be introduced to the area. The reed beds provide a source of insect species that have juvenile stages in water, such as the dragonfly.",True,2449,2559,37628,37689

1139246,"The purpose of this essay is to determine the process of team work within a multi-professional culture, using appropriate models and reflective cycles. As a health care professional (HCP), it is necessary to understand the importance of being able to work as part of a multi-professional team. The ability to respect other HCP's knowledge and values, as a member of a team is expressed within the UKCC's midwives rules and code of practice (2002). This also helps to promote transculturally acceptable health care (Papadopoulos, 1998). Reflection is also an integral part of any HCP's practice as a process of self examination and the development of skills, which enables practice to be enhanced (Sweet, 2003). A definition of a good team is a group chosen from members with complimentary capabilities; working together they can achieve a planned purpose (Naylor, 1999). I explored a number of different theoretical models surrounding team work including Bates and Johnson (2001), Bennis and Shepard (1956), Tuckman (2002) and Bion (1996).","By wearing mufti we, as midwives, are encouraging autonomy in childbirth and an equal relationship to develop (Pride, 1995) From the perspective that clients will be very likely to use different services whilst pregnant and are unlikely to know the midwives who will care for them in labour and the post natal wards the use of a similar uniform in all areas may benefit the client as it may instil confidence in the practitioner and be familiar and comforting if all staff wear the same uniform. This was a recurring opinion in a study conducted by Sparrow (1991). Although the study was conducted on a small scale public opinion was very strong with comments such as 'people feel unafraid when they see nurses in uniform (pp118) and 'they would seem less knowledgeable if not in uniform. The other professionals wear uniform (pp119). Interestingly though a large number of women questioned revealed that they had a strong preference for midwives not to wear uniform when they were conducting home visits suggesting they could normalise the relationship when in their own home, but preferred the midwife in uniform when in a clinical setting (Leventon, 1989).",True,1010,2136,25077,25146

Moreover, the structure of article is well planned, and also main arguments and isotope results are highlighted clearly. However, it might be preferred that the application of scattergram with valuable isotope results. Furthermore, this article is quoted by the numbers of authors, therefore it is clear this article have been considered as making large contribution to the study of subsistence change at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. However limitations for isotope measurements are introduced only a small number, there are, in particular, ""preliminary models"" which show that a diet dominated by terrestrial food might include up to 20 per cent of marine protein without raising the stable isotope values (Barbereba and Borrero 2004:191-195). Moreover, this article has not been supported by the cultural continuity, which tends to be observed from faunal assemblages.","Thus, it could be say approach only offers a basis ""for describing and comparing distributions which are already reasonably well documented"" it does not provide sufficient grounds for inferring the character of the processes that lay behind those patterns(Bradley,R. Edmonds,M.1993:7-8). Hence, there is certainly a necessity for more of these detailed, further problem oriented regional studies to improve this approach. This conclusion attempts to summarise the application of anthropological approaches to the study of pre-capitalist economies in archaeological term. According to this essay, there are two main anthropological schools of the study of exchange system in pre-capitalist society. Substantivist commonly assumes pre-capitalist economy is embedded in social relation, and tends to be considered that pre-capitalist economy were mainly derived from two types of exchange systems, reciprocity and redistribution. The concepts of these exchange systems were represented by anthropological case studied of aboriginal societies. The study of New Guinea and American Northwest coast indicates that there were several reciprocities within social contexts, which was sustained by exchange of valuables between alliances.",True,672,1750,35189,35236

Finally, after the People's Republic of China government rejected universal suffrage for the 2007 Chief Executive election in Hong Kong, claiming that the city was not ready for full democracy as it lacked the necessary political talent; people in Hong Kong started to have the same outcry as Weber did in the post World War I Germany, ""What was lacking was the direction of the state by a politician - not by a political genius, to be expected only once every few centuries, not even by a great political talent, but simply by a politician"" (ES 1405).

Is qualitative research adequate in answering the questions about power? Many scholars do not think so. They expressed concern that the ""macro explanation"" may not be adequately supported by the ""micro observation"" derived from the daily school life (West 1984). Indeed, in Kahl's ""Educational and Occupational Aspiration of 'Common Man' Boys"" (1953), he attempted to answer a similar question with multi-strategy research. In responding to this concern, one may combine quantitative and qualitative strategies to ""bridge the gap"" between the micro and macro level, as what Pahl attempted to accomplish in ""Money and Marriage"".",True,192,2599,19003,19059
